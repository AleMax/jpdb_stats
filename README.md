The easiest way to run this if you do not have a Jupyter installation of your own is to 
1. go to https://jupyter.org/try 
2. click on JupyterLab
3. Upload the jpdb_stats.ipynb from this repo and your vocabulary-reviews.json downloadable from the settings page (at the bottom)
4. Open the ipynb file
5. Hit the |>|> button
